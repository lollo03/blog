On October 26th, 2024, during the [Linux Day in Milan](https://linuxdaymilano.org/), I spoke for the first time in front of an audience about a topic I am particularly passionate about: self-hosting.

Below, you can find the abstract of the talk, along with the video and slides.


## Abstract

The goal of the talk is to present a new perspective on self-hosting to an audience already familiar with the topic. After introducing the reasons for "self-hosting," the talk will touch on some upcoming products marketed as "single board servers," that is, single board computers with a focus on networking and expanded connectivity features. 

Following that, it will showcase the use of NixOS to configure a machine for self-hosting through a walk-through approach, drawing parallels with more common distributions. 

The talk will be presented by two students from Politecnico di Milano, members of POuL.
